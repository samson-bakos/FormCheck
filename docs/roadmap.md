## Proof of Concept - Squat Faults

Start by working only on Squats, no classification.

### 1. Data Collection:

Collect necessary data using instagram. Augment as needed. Include diversity of people performing the target lifts. Include variations in body types, clothing, and environments. Aim to acquire diverse angles. Should be reasonable using instagram population.

Manually annotate data with faults.
