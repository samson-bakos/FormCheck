UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Current plan is to use the Instagram Public API to pull videos under the hastags 'squat' or 'squats' and manually annotate targets. 

Focus will begin with fault identification of squats only as proof of concept, as this is the more challenging of the two challenges (classifying lifts should be easier). 

Manual dataset augmentation (demonstration of specifc faults or lift qualities) may be explored depending on class balancing.
